Progrmming for mechatronics systems:
The subject presents the theoretical foundations of object-oriented programming and design using C++ and provides
students with skills in the design and implementation of a code base for mechatronics systems of moderate complexity.
This subject familiarises students with approaches to design and implement code that is modular, re-usable, reliable
and maintainable.
Working on an individual project that requires the design and implementation of part of a mechatronic system allows
students to apply their knowledge to a real-life problem.
Topics include: objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, run-time instantiation, threading, thread
communication, event handling, use of generic features of C++ such as the STL and utilising APIs, middleware,
documentation and testing.
