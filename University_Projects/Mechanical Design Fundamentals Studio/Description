The development of design solutions to well defined problems is a key to success in the engineering world. This
subject is the first in a pair of studios that are focused on developing fundamental skills in engineering design. It builds
on concepts introduced in earlier subjects and applies these to a major design-and-build project. Principally, students
work on a well-defined design problem to develop skills and experience in the mechanical and/or mechatronic
engineering design process and the application of good design practices to the design and build of a mechanical
device. Students apply good mechanical design practice to design and build a mechanical device and to implement
mechatronics principles to develop a mechatronic system to control a mechanical device. Success in this subject is
strongly linked to the ability to collaborate as a team and to communicate and document design ideas, decisions,
justifications, calculations, and outcomes.
